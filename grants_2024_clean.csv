The partnership has the potential to reach 44 million listeners and users across public radio, streaming and digital platforms. RNS would provide unparalleled editorial expertise about religion reporting to public media journalists.

Both residents and researchers have said that prevailing approaches to covering gun violence in Chicago can cause harm. Meanwhile, officials in City Hall and Springfield have often tried to blame gun violence on under-resourced communities, even as those leaders fail to do more to implement and sustain equitable solutions. To combat this, last year we established a bureau in Chicago to challenge misleading narratives and drive more beneficial coverage of the city’s fight against gun violence. Employing an initial team of two native Chicago journalists – one producing accountability and solutions reporting, the other dedicated to community engagement – our investment is equipping The Trace to play an important role in sustaining the civic dialogues critical to building safer communities. Alongside our reporting, this year we engaged our first cohort of gun violence survivors through a Survivor Storytelling Project that empowers Chicago survivors of gun violence to tell their own stories, ensuring that those most impacted by the problem are directly shaping the narrative around shootings. Funding from the Paul M. Angell Foundation will enable us to: * Produce a min. of 12 articles that will compare Chicago’s official response to gun violence to what experts and residents say is really needed; scrutinize the implementation of the new state gun violence prevention package in IL; and distill the findings of research on the root causes and solutions to gun violence so that those insights reach policymakers and the public. * Complete the second year of our Survivor Storytelling Project, which will empower and compensate gun violence survivors to produce their own narratives. * Develop or expand collaborations with diverse Chicago media partners to amplify our impact and ensure we’re reaching communities with the highest need.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

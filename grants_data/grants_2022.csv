As part of the assessment process, the OECD/PARIS21 will produce a General Climate Data Template that can be a starting point for creating a national inventory of global, regional, and local climate data requirements and needs in the pilot country. The OECD/PARIS21 will also complete a template on Open Climate Data to assess climate change data availability, openness, and use in several countries, drawing on ODW?s Open Data Inventory, as a context for examining those issues in the pilot country. Ultimately, the pilot will create a scalable collaboration model to help other countries also leverage climate change data to advance effective and inclusive climate change adaptation policies while supporting international efforts around climate change mitigation.

This represents Florida and Caribbean populations, with data coming from practitioners and researchers alike. The data can be used to tell a more complete story of restoration efforts across the region and across all harvested species. The CSR is also being well received in the Caribbean, where we are reaching out to all coral agencies to introduce the tool and get data. As we introduce the registry throughout the Caribbean, our science team has had the opportunity to expand the international features of the registry. CRF has started work on the next phase of coral data integration: a metaportal. Using the CSR accession number as a ‘key’ the metaportal will be access various coral-related databases to both aggregate data and find unique, insightful connections. Prospective users include academic researchers, restoration practitioners and government agencies charged with monitoring permitting activities. Additionally, a publicly facing component will allow for anyone to see the progress on coral restoration at various sites around the world. The interface will be web-based and easily accessibly across various platforms. Initial user groups have been identified with draft use-cases in development. A community of broad stakeholders has been invited to participate, with the first in-person meeting tentatively scheduled for Reef Futures 2022 being held in September in Key Largo, Florida. The stakeholder group will focus on two things: continued identification of data structures for inclusion, and drafting of the visualization interface including pre-scripted reports. Working with the software developers used for the CSR project, CRF has already started initial structure design, researching hosting options, and developing API scripts for data access. In recent years CRF has championed a change in the metrics used to evaluate the efficacy of coral restoration projects, moving from fate-tracking of individual corals to the calculation of area restored (i.e. increase in coral biomass) in a region over time. This has been made possible through technological advances in photogrammetry, specifically the ability to stitch together a large number of individual photographs into a single mosaic image. However, the cost of producing such photomosaics is prohibitive to most restoration practitioners around the world. To close this economic-bias, CRF has developed a low-cost photography protocol (using inexpensive GoPro cameras), an online stitching pipeline (leveraging the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture) and is finalizing machine-learning algorithms to automatically recognize key coral species and generate restoration-appropriate metrics. While our current work has drastically cut the time and money required to assess coral reefs and monitoring the progress of restoration efforts, we strongly believe that we can further reduce implementation costs.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

To this end, the Global Investigative Journalism Network will update and expand its toolkit of issue and practice guides, tip sheets and trainings that assist journalists and correspondents to understand both the news value and the forensic needs of documenting evidence of a war crime. The toolkit will be translated into Ukrainian and Russian initially and will be distributed throughout the grantee’s network. This effort will be boosted by engagement of a Ukrainian-speaking editor able to respond quickly to requests from Ukrainian journalists for resources to document potential crimes. Founded in 2003, the Global Investigative Journalism Network has grown to include 227 member groups in 82 countries and works to link together the world’s most enterprising journalists, giving them the tools, technology and training to uncover abuses of power and lack of accountability.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

This pro bono network will contribute to the strengthening of Colombian democratic society by enabling individuals playing a watchdog role to participate in public debate as a result of an adequate defense in legal disputes affecting their freedom of expression. Furthermore, the pro bono network will play a vital role in increasing the commitment of the legal profession with key social issues.Judicial harassment or use of judicial mechanisms to censor and intimidate people publishing information of public interest such as journalists, media outlets or social media users, either for their journalistic work and/or for the defense of human rights are a worrying trend in Colombia. According to Colombian press-watchdog Fundación para la Libertad de Prensa (FLIP), the number of legal actions intended to silence journalists went from 14 in 2017 to 66 in 2019 and up to 36 in 2020 and in 2021 too. The portfolio of powerful individuals abusing of legal actions to censor freedom of expression on matters of public interest has traditionally included criminal defamation as a main tool. However, civil lawsuits and constitutional writs (tutela) have become complementary and even more effective means for silence. Simultaneously, corruption, human rights violations and other pressing social issues prevail, which calls for wider protections of public debate.Such a phenomenon shows a high demand for legal defense in freedom of expression disputes. Traditionally, individuals in legal risk for exercising their freedom of expression have had limited avenues for their defense, which tends to be costly. FLIP has provided legal defense through its in-house team but limited in numbers and just to journalists and media outlets. FLIP’s mandate is the wide defense of freedom of expression in public debate, while El Veinte aims to provide individual defense securing access to justice. Since 2020, El Veinte plays a key role responding to Colombia’s high demand. El Veinte has allowed access to adequate defense and has provided pre-emptive support to journalists by legal editing their work. This project will thus strengthen civil society’s response to the existing challenge of legal harassment against freedom of expression.El Veinte focuses on those without economic means for an adequate defense and prioritize beneficiaries from municipalities without effective legal protection and with economic limitations. El Veinte applies a gender and inclusive criteria by prioritizing the defense of those exercising freedom of expression on issues affecting gender issues and issues related to other less represented groups.Asides from El Veinte, no other organization working on freedom of expression in Colombia focuses on the promotion of pro bono work.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Founded in 1973, PBMF was developed to advocate for blacks in the media. It seeks fair representation of the African-American community in the news and an increased presence of minorities in newsrooms. PBMF also was designed to create a social network for black media professionals in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. In the early 1990s, PBMF became an affiliate of the National Association of Black Journalists. This collaboration between the recently announced Pittsburgh Cultural Treasures Initiative and the Pittsburgh Black Media Federation engages Pittsburgh writers and a local photographer to help tell the stories of the 16 nonprofit arts organizations and artist collectives identified as part of the Ford Foundation’s regional challenge grant.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

The funding will go into our general operations account and provide the flexibility needed to make strategic decisions regarding staffing, editorial direction, website development and community outreach. The emergence of nonprofit local news organizations over the past decade has shown that it is critical to have a business plan supported by at least 3 years of philanthropic funding to effectively grow and develop an organization. The Institute for Nonprofit News, The Lenfest Institute and the American Journalism Project all emphasize the importance of philanthropy and having a strong business plan prior to launch. In fact, national foundations and donors like those mentioned above often require funding commitments from local foundations and donors as a signal of a community's willingness to invest in local news. Without having that level of support and planning, well-intended news organizations with strong journalistic credentials can struggle to find an audience and make an impact in their communities. In response, Central Current has launched a fundraising campaign with a $1 million goal. The majority of our first-year budget will be covered by campaign funds. The grant from the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust will be pooled with other 3-year commitments from individual donors and foundations to support the implementation of our startup business plan. Key components of that plan include hiring staff, community engagement, and designing a dynamic online publication and social media presence. These are critical components to building our news product and growing additional revenue streams including memberships, sponsorships, and earned income from programs and events. Initial staff will include an editor-in-chief, 3 full-time journalists, and freelance contributors. A business manager will oversee business operations including revenue development, information technology, marketing, and community relations. Community engagement will be our cornerstone to acquiring the knowledge, awareness and feedback surrounding the issues we cover in the news, and it will also be critical to growing a strong and diverse audience. We plan to launch our publication in Spring 2022. Central Current maintains a clear policy of editorial independence and financial transparency. While community and audience engagement will be important activities that inform our editorial strategy, all decisions regarding news content will be made exclusively by journalists without the direct influence or interference of donors, sponsors, board members and business operations. In addition, we will publicly disclose the amounts and sources of all gifts, grants and sponsors.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Students performing below expectations enter high school without the writing, reading and critical thinking skills necessary to succeed in high school. They fall further behind and are more likely to become chronically absent or drop out. Those who do graduate from an underperforming school are not necessarily ready to succeed in college or career, often leaving them relegated to low wage jobs that perpetuate poverty. JerseyCAN reports that, based on student achievement at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, the school disruptions caused by COVID-19 are creating up to a 40% drop in English Language Arts proficiency among economically disadvantaged students, compared with about 30% for students overall. McKinsey & Co. reports that Black students were an average of six months behind at the end of the 2020-2021 school year, negatively impacting their future potential, including loss of up to $61,000 in lifetime earnings. Write on Sports (WoS) is requesting $10,000 to support operation and expansion of its innovative theme-based education programs for New Jersey middle school students at risk of failing. Through two-week summer camps and 10-12 week after-school programs, students improve their writing, reading, research and critical thinking abilities, sparked by enthusiasm for sports. The camps also introduce students to sports journalists who model interviewing skills and techniques by interviewing athletes and offer information on career pathways. Program interns are alumni who serve as role models for students, promoting the importance of academic achievement for future opportunities. The flagship programs include students from Newark, the Oranges, Hawthorne, Clifton and Montclair. Program participants become entry-level sports journalists. Students work both in groups and individually. Group activities include: interviewing guest sports professionals, players or coaches before a game; interviewing a guest in “locker room” mode; brainstorming and narrowing down ideas; discussing different versions of a story, and presenting a story to the group and creating a video feature story. Individual activities include writing a series of spot stories and a print feature story; Internet research; story revision; word choice; copy editing; keeping a notebook of previously unknown words they find in news stories; creating and keeping up individual blogs; keeping within time limits; and continuing to answer the question ""What is your story, and how does this help move it forward?"" WoS was recently awarded a contract from the Newark Public Schools to operate up to 6 after-school programs in the current school year, with more to follow in 2022-2023. Funding will be used to support both summer and after-school programs in Northern New Jersey.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Newspapers are closing and shrinking and cutting print publication days. There are fewer journalists: the Pew Research Center says U.S. newsroom employment dropped 26% between 2008 and 2021. A University of North Carolina study described many U.S. counties as “news deserts,” lacking coverage of professional journalists. A PEN America study concluded that, as local reporting declined, “government officials conduct themselves with less integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness” and corporate malfeasance often goes unnoticed. At the same time, however, a diversity of new news firms is emerging, often digital and nonprofit. This is occurring in Nevada with such digital-native organizations as The Nevada Independent, This is Reno, the Sierra Nevada Ally and the RSJ’s Noticiero Móvil bilingual news service. Amid this sort of experimentation, as the Columbia Journalism Review noted, “Local news, it seems, is both failing and transforming, suffering and succeeding, clinging to life and sustaining communities.” In this mediascape, the RSJ seeks to establish a Project for Local News Revitalization. The project would draw upon the professional and research resources of the RSJ, in collaboration with staff of our public radio station, KUNR. The goal is to develop innovative approaches to sustaining and invigorating local journalism, on both legacy and native-digital platforms. Outcomes would include: 1. R&D on experimental business models and new approaches to journalistic practice: RSJ faculty, in collaboration with visiting media-business experts and entrepreneurs, would develop experiments with monetization of content and storytelling forms; KUNR and RSJ startups could be used as test beds 2. public outreach and events to raise awareness of the situation: programs such as last fall’s Cole Campbell Dialogues in Democracy “Local News Matters” events would be organized to promote civic literacy around the link between journalism and democratic process 3. professional development workshops: RSJ would organize workshops for regional journalists to share and apply best practices for sustaining and invigorating local news 4. production of White Papers and scholarly articles by RSJ researchers: RSJ’s Center for Advanced Media Studies, the research arm of the j-school, would produce White Papers and academic publications for national dissemination about the project’s findings. RSJ undergraduate and graduate students will also benefit from the project. Students would help conduct research, implement content experiments in classes and RSJ startups, produce White Papers and research publications with faculty, and participate in public events and professional development workshops. The Project for Local News Revitalization would become an ongoing Reynolds School program. We would augment JBSMT support with funding from other foundations that have us provided grants, from individual donors, and from existing RSJ accounts when appropriate.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

For this purpose, we have identified 200 female members from 10 women’s groups. It will consist in training a 10-woman incubator (1 woman per group) so that they become reporters and promoters of radio programs in their communities and organizations. The goal is to produce inclusive, non-discriminatory content. The topics discussed will focus on gender and women’s rights in order to raise collective awareness. It will also enable the consolidation of actions between community organizations of rural women, and local, religious, and administrative authorities for the protection of women’s rights. Thanks to the synergy developed with several actors (radio stations, NGOs, local authorities, religious leaders, etc.), alliances will be created to broadcast these programs on other radio stations, social networks, and other organizations in the Kindia region. These 10 targeted women’s organizations will form a network, their organizational and institutional capacities will be strengthened, and their members will be trained on gender-based violence. Thus, these women will become real agents of change to move the lines and create a snowball effect for the promotion of women’s rights in Kindia.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

In fall 2020, SU’s population was 53% white while 77% of The D.O.'s staff identified as white, according to SU’s Fall 2020 Census and The D.O.’s own data (source: https://issuu.com/dailyorange/docs/daily_orange_diversity_report_fall_2020). This lack of diversity is reflected in our coverage. The fellowship grants will award four student journalists of color at SU and SUNY-ESF $2,000 each to craft a body of work over the course of a year that they otherwise would not have been able to create without our financial support. Recipients will be selected at the beginning of each academic year by a panel of community members and D.O. alumni, who will be selected by The Daily Orange Diversity Committee. To make the fellowship as accessible as possible, the only eligibility requirements will be that the applicants must be SU or SUNY-ESF students at least one year away from graduating and they must identify as people of color. Recipients will be chosen based on their demonstrated financial need as well as their written proposals about subjects they would like to cover. Recipients are not confined to the subjects they highlight in their application — rather, the application statement should serve as an idea brainstorm. Additionally, applicants do not need to focus on or write about a subject that relates to BIPOC communities to be considered for the award — they are encouraged to pursue whatever stories they may be interested in, regardless of the subject’s relevance to diversity and inclusion. Once the four fellowship recipients have been selected, the panel will arrange one-on-one meetings with each to discuss their plans for the upcoming year. Together with the recipients, the panel will brainstorm how The D.O. can further provide structured support to help them achieve their goals. The panel will also assign a senior staffer from The Daily Orange to mentor each fellow. Fellows will work with D.O. staffers and alumni mentors to craft their story or project, and The D.O. will aim to publish any articles, photographs, videos or other media created by the fellows. If editors at The D.O. determine a fellow's work would be better suited for another outlet, such as a student magazine or radio station, they will help forge connections with leaders at those organizations to make this happen.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

However, as an unpaid internship, participants must cover the cost of housing and travel related to the internship. For some, these educational expenses over and above tuition (room, board, travel, supplies) might preclude them from accepting an internship that could advance their education or career. With direct scholarship support, The Gazette can alleviate some financial burden associated with the internship and expand access to this program for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in journalism. As local journalism and news organizations struggle across the country, The Gazette is a longstanding example of innovative partnerships between students, journalism programs, and local news. As such, The Gazette trains student journalists to meet the growing need for objective reporting from diverse voices, particularly on subjects like government and politics. Recently, The Gazette launched the first episode of its new podcast, which brought together journalism and production students for a collaborative project that is generating excitement among students. Additionally The Gazette is poised to collaborate with and publish articles in local media such as The River, an independent news outlet with coverage of the Hudson Valley and Catskills regions. To ensure greater access to The Gazette internship and attract a diverse cohort of students, it is critical for SUNY New Paltz to provide direct support to students for non-tuition educational expenses as they are engaged in this rigorous program. Between Spring 2020 and Fall 2021, SUNY New Paltz awarded scholarships to 27 out of 67 Legislative Gazette students. Of those awarded scholarships, 17 students identified as female; and 10 identified as nonwhite. Scholarships are awarded by The Legislative Gazette in collaboration with the SUNY New Paltz Foundation. Student need is identified and validated by the director of The Legislative Gazette, as well as the Assistant Director of Stewardship at the Foundation and staff in the Office of Student Financial Services. Funding raised for scholarships in one calendar year is awarded the following year through an application process.Therefore, funding received in 2022 is awarded in the 2023-2024 academic year; and scholarship applications are available in March 2023 and awarded in April 2023. Support from the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust would allow SUNY New Paltz to increase the amount of scholarships available to students from groups traditionally underrepresented in journalism.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

We seek to bring the expertise and professional leadership at TTJ together with the knowledge and strong history of excellence at the Franklin College Pulliam School of Journalism to create support for trauma journalists around the world. The first step toward establishing such a Center for Excellence will be the launching of an inaugural symposium in the fall of 2022. This inaugural Trauma Journalism Symposium will bring to the heartland of America a critically important topic facing not only journalists, but all who are touched by trauma and tragedy. Over the course of two days on the Franklin College campus in central Indiana, survivors will share stories, experts will provide information, and attendees will be inspired and educated about the implications of trauma and how they can better deal with it in their professional and personal lives. Franklin College hopes to inspire your philanthropic investment, and requests your consideration of a gift to help us launch the inaugural Trauma for Journalism Symposium, to be held on the Franklin College campus in the fall of 2022. Your gift will provide the seed funding needed to not only host an exciting and meaningful two-day event, but to launch the idea that, by working together, we can have a positive impact on journalists who experience life-altering trauma over the course of their careers. Expenses may include the following: • scholarship dollars to help students interested in trauma journalism attend the symposium at no cost to them • funding for meals to be served to attendees—four (4) over the course of two days; • and dollars to help pay for marketing materials necessary to spread the word far and wide about the inaugural symposium (including print materials, advertisements, and social media “boosts"").",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

There is a significant need for bilingual journalism education, driven largely by demographic changes in our region. According to recent census data, 29% of Washoe County residents are Hispanic. As a result, there is high demand from professional news organizations for bilingual journalists and strategic communicators, yet there is a shortage of media firms providing Spanish-language journalistic content or providing marketing services to Latino audiences. The RSJ is singularly positioned to meet this need, with more than 20 percent of the student body identifying as Hispanic. The RSJ currently operates a bilingual news service, Noticiero Mvil, funded in part through national and regional grants. Through Noticiero Mvil, we have established connections with Latino communities as well as with media organizations interested in serving Latino audiences, both in Spanish and English. In addition, the RSJ is the first journalism school in the nation to partner with National Public Radio to train students of color for careers in public media, with a particular focus on Latino journalists, through our annual Next Generation Radio Nevada Boot Camp, entering its seventh year in 2019. We have developed the curriculum for the new academic track and are shepherding the course proposals through the Universitys approval process. In the meantime, we are conducting a “soft launch” of the program by offering three courses during the current academic year: a survey course on media portrayals of Latinos, a course in multicultural consumer research, and a campaigns course in partnership with the Reno Aces, to develop a marketing campaign to engage the Latino community with special themed events at ballgames. Since submitting our original LOI, we have: hired a bilingual tenure-track faculty member to teach and conduct research in the Bilingual Media track; developed a curriculum, which is now going through the Universitys course approval process; established a Community Podcasting Studio in downtown Reno, in which our students will work with community members to produce podcasts in Spanish and English; established a dual degree program in Journalism and Spanish, with the Department of World Languages, and formed a partnership with the Reno Aces to develop a marketing campaign to engage the Northern Nevada Latino community. Another development since our original LOI is the University administrations decision to shift KUNR public radio under Reynolds School oversight, effective July 1, 2018. This has provided new opportunities for bilingual student journalists to produce content for broadcast and digital distribution, and enhanced the stations service to the regions Latino community. In fact, an RSJ student was awarded a national Edward R. Murrow Award for excellence in radio journalism for a story she produced which aired on KUNR.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

We have revised our request to funding for our 2020 production of Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun. A Raisin in the Sun tells the story of an African-american family living in Chicago's Southside dealing with issues of identity, white-flight, and racism. Set in late 1950'S Chicago, we aim to bring this world to life through period-specific props, costumes, and furniture pieces. As gentrification continues to occur in Chicago and minorities find less opportunities to express their voices, this timely story illuminates the disparities of the American Dream. The show will run from 2/13/20-3/15/20 for 20 performances and 4 preview performances. The revised budget for this production is $18,300. This production will take place at The Buena theater at the Pride Arts Center. While all of our programming is important, including our Shakespeare in the Courts outreach program, we find it hardest to find support for our main stage productions such as A Raisin in the Sun. These productions allow us to actively connect with our Chicago communities through relevant and moving stories such as A Raisin in the Sun. While this grant from you would cover a large portion of our budget, your support would also bring credibility to our organization as we seek to introduce our work to additional stakeholders throughout the city of Chicago, with a long term goal of diversifying our funding sources. This grant will also provide the Angell Foundation a chance to work with a small, but professional, young theater company and see our process first hand before making further funding commitments. Regarding our organizational infrastructure. I have included a description of our company members and roles along with our board list to give a more complete picture of company operations. Thank you for your time and consideration.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

One of the founders of the organization visited Rojava, a autonomous administration of North and East Syria, and used the current political environment to raise awareness around women's organizations and advocate for the defense of Rojava against US complicity with Turkey's war on the Kurds. The funds will cover tour expenses and a consultant to coordinate activities. The outcomes are to build more US-based support and national movements as well as collaboration with activists from Black Lives Matter.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

It can take weeks or months to verify information about a vessel's identity and behavior through official channels, by which time it may have left the region. In lower-income countries, where data and technological capacity is often especially limited, managing this issue is even more difficult. The result is vast swathes of ocean where unscrupulous actors operate in the shadows with relative impunity. At the heart of the problem lies a simple truth: We cannot effectively manage what we cannot see. A lack of data, transparency and accountability leads to poor management. Transparency is about making information, including ocean and vessel data, related policies and decision-making processes, openly available and accessible. Transparency supports better policies and planning, fosters accountability, drives better enforcement, and enables diverse stakeholders to participate in decision-making. Without accurate and open information on vessel activities and on the owners profiting from their operations, States cannot take effective action to eliminate illegal fishing. With an investment from the Paul M. Angell Family Foundation, our international policy work will support key fisheries countries to revolutionize the global fisheries governance framework and its implementation. We will strategically target influential countries in the FAO, OECD, and regional fisheries bodies to gain support for unprecedented new regional and global rules. These rules will ensure the tracking of commercial fishing vessels and reveal their ownership, preventing illicit operations and improving vessel control and defense of waters. We will secure a significant improvement in how they control their vessels, defend their waters and prevent companies at the end of a fishing vessel's ownership chain from operating in secrecy. Our key countries will serve as exemplars, demonstrating vessel tracking and transparent ownership is practically and politically feasible. International and regional policies will underpin national leadership and utilize our global data platform to transform accountability systems, leading to a paradigm shift in how we understand and manage global fisheries.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

We also propose to support another 20 journalists producing climate solutions stories that help audiences become even better informed about the impacts of our changing climate in their own communities and learn how other communities are responding more effectively to similar challenges. Through a combination of stories published by the cohort of fellows, and others sourced through SJN's broad and growing network, this project will result in 100 solutions stories shared in their original format, adapted for radio, and broadly amplified through PNS's large network of radio partners. Finally, we will foster a community of practice that collectively contributes stories, insights and resources to SJN's network and beyond to inspire and practically support other journalists who want to bring a focus on climate solutions into the mainstream of environmental reporting.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

This represents Florida and Caribbean populations, with data coming from practitioners and researchers alike. The data can be used to tell a more complete story of restoration efforts across the region and across all harvested species. The CSR is also being well received in the Caribbean, where we are reaching out to all coral agencies to introduce the tool and get data. As we introduce the registry throughout the Caribbean, our science team has had the opportunity to expand the international features of the registry. CRF has started work on the next phase of coral data integration: a metaportal. Using the CSR accession number as a â€˜key' the metaportal will be access various coral-related databases to both aggregate data and find unique, insightful connections. Prospective users include academic researchers, restoration practitioners and government agencies charged with monitoring permitting activities. Additionally, a publicly facing component will allow for anyone to see the progress on coral restoration at various sites around the world. The interface will be web-based and easily accessibly across various platforms. Initial user groups have been identified with draft use-cases in development. A community of broad stakeholders has been invited to participate, with the first in-person meeting tentatively scheduled for Reef Futures 2022 being held in September in Key Largo, Florida. The stakeholder group will focus on two things: continued identification of data structures for inclusion, and drafting of the visualization interface including pre-scripted reports. Working with the software developers used for the CSR project, CRF has already started initial structure design, researching hosting options, and developing API scripts for data access. 2) Autonomous Imaging Drone: In recent years CRF has championed a change in the metrics used to evaluate the efficacy of coral restoration projects, moving from fate-tracking of individual corals to the calculation of area restored (i.e. increase in coral biomass) in a region over time. This has been made possible through technological advances in photogrammetry, specifically the ability to stitch together a large number of individual photographs into a single mosaic image. However, the cost of producing such photomosaics is prohibitive to most restoration practitioners around the world. To close this economic-bias, CRF has developed a low-cost photography protocol (using inexpensive GoPro cameras), an online stitching pipeline (leveraging the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture) and is finalizing machine-learning algorithms to automatically recognize key coral species and generate restoration-appropriate metrics.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Futuro has been a pioneer in uplifting Latinx voices in media and in creating multi-media platforms for a Latinx audience. Furthermore, Futuro’s partnership with The Foundation led to the development of a leadership pipeline for young women and TGNC youth to enter the field and become producers at Futuro Studios. These young people also expanded the types of topics and stories covered through In the Thick podcast, elevating other communities and intersectional experiences of young people and families in New York City and beyond. Futuro’s mission as an independent, nonprofit organization producing multimedia journalism that explores and gives a critical voice to the diversity of the American experience is well aligned with the intersectional and gender justice lens The Foundation focuses on. Futuro is based in Harlem and founded in 2010 by award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, an award-winning journalist committed to telling stories from points of view often overlooked by mainstream media. During this grant year, Futuro underwent a staffing restructure to make room for a new initiative that will now become its own organization, Futuro Unidad Hinajosa, for investigative journalism and special projects. As such, Futuro Studios continued to host their long-standing podcasts, but had to pause production of new shows for Latino Rebels and Latino USA. They also saw the decrease and pause of large grants that sustained their work. The development of donor cultivation initiatives and donation drives are currently underway, as the work had traditionally been sustained through foundation grants. For the next grant year, Futuro would like to hire a permanent Executive Director and resume full production of their shows. They are working with other industry partners on stories that will be featured in their different shows. They are also looking to work more collaboratively with groups engaging directly with individuals willing to tell their stories around ongoing and emerging issues in New York City.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

In October, as part of a year-long project with USA TODAY, we analyzed and documented how climate change will increase fertilizer runoff. Our reporting found that while Champaign County helps feed the nation’s demand for corn and soybeans it also fuels one of the more insidious impacts of climate change – fertilizer runoff. In February, we reported that while most large companies have policies to reduce water use and pollution, some of the largest meat companies in the U.S. lack measures such as water reduction targets, watershed protection plans and incentives for suppliers to conserve water. In April, we reported that lettuce and other leafy greens continue to be the source of E. Coli outbreaks from neighboring animal operations despite federal prevention efforts. This year, we’ve partnered up with the University of Missouri’s Mississippi River Ag and Water Desk, a collaborative reporting network providing in-depth journalism and communication about water, agriculture and environmental issues across the Mississippi River Basin and have dedicated a reporter to this beat, with periodic assistance from other editorial staff. This collaboration allows us great access to more audiences, expertise and journalism resources to fully report on the issues most relevant to Central Illinois’ agriculture and rural communities. Funds from the Lumpkin Family Foundation will be used to produce in-depth stories focused on agriculture, climate change and water as part of this collaboration. This work includes data analysis of publicly available federal and state data and reports and graphics and other visualizations of that data. The results will be shared through our collaborative network and media partners to not only inform and educate the communities, public officials, advocates and critics who may have the resources to influence constructive change.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

This violence is known to be connected to extractive industry. In 2019 the Department of Justice publish a report that found a 70% increase in aggravated assault correlating with the introduction of extractive industry with no similar rise in surrounding counties. Moreover, this violence is underreported on and when it is covered it is mis-reported. It is common for reporters to not acknowledge the Tribal affiliations of victims, frame the stories as personal failures rather than structural, dehumanize victims, or causes further trauma through lack of coordination or consideration of the victims relatives. The focus of the grant project is to work with MMIP victims and families to understand their experience and impacts of violence. In addition to our current awareness event organizing efforts, scheduling listening sessions would be beneficial for MMIP families in the Great Basin. These sessions will help communities in healing and processing trauma through access to some of the stories that should be shared about the violence, enforcement protocol, connection to resource extraction, and the victims left behind. In this four-part podcast series we are proposing to educate the public on local public radio networks. The amplification of Indigenous voices are broadly needed to share their stories and the trauma they continue to live with. We want to accentuate the poor reporting from the media (newspapers, television, radio, books, etc.) in regards to MMIP cases which have resulted in less attention on Indigenous people when they go missing or murdered, We are confident that we will provide adequate media resource guidance through the media toolkit. The purpose of the toolkit is to provide the historical context of the issue, center Indigenous voices, prevent stereotypes when referring to Indigenous Peoples, and create media that is accurate and respectful. We would like to welcome participation from the UNR School of Journalism and others to attend a training on MMIP and coverage of Indigenous Peoples. Our goal is to utilize the listening session project to help build more powerful reporting on the issue of MMIP. Overall, this would be part of the cultural sensitivity needs of the media to accurately report on what is culturally and traditional accepted. While working to produce the media resources tool kit, this will assist in amplifying the awareness campaign as we work with UNR's School of Journalism, KUNR, and other media outlets.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

His reporting in 2022 has been essential to educating the Northern Nevada region on issues surrounding homeless services, and his coverage of the 2022 election provided critical information on voting rights, election integrity and issues critical to a broad range of Washoe County's demographic. As a result, we are seeking a third round of funding from the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust to ensure this position is well-funded to encourage more small and large donors to give to this effort. In his role as a full-time local government reporter, Robison has had an immediate and meaningful impact on the Reno-Sparks community. Homelessness is on the rise -- the Point In Time count recorded a 28% increase from 2021 in the number of homeless people in Reno-area shelters. Just released medical examiner data shows the 2022 number of homeless deaths almost doubled from 2021. Meanwhile, Reno-Sparks is facing a critical shortage of affordable housing, and local governments approved development in the city core that has eliminated hundreds of options for those in the lowest income bracket. The decisions made by our local governments affect thousands of people living on the edge. Robison's beat sheds light on problems, holds leaders accountable and shows how our community can implement positive change for those who need it most.  He is the key to reporting on all of that. By raising another $25,000 from the memorial trust, we will be that much closer to sustainability, allowing us to cover Robison's $65,000 per year salary. As part of his role, Robison serves as our director of community engagement — overseeing public forums and events related to local government education as well as aid in our fundraising efforts to help pay for his position. Robison is a full-time employee of Gannett, the parent company of the Reno Gazette Journal. The company pays for his health care and other benefits as well as equipment needs such as a laptop. Editing, training, story coaching, visual journalism support, digital and print production and other forms of professional support are provided by the RGJ newsroom and Gannett.   The Reno Gazette Journal Fund is a field of interest fund established in 2020 with the Community Foundation of Northern Nevada. The fund allows our organization to seek out charitable donations and foundation grants to sustain in-depth public service journalism in Northern Nevada. The fund is used to compensate journalist(s) for their time to investigate, research and report on public service topics that will be distributed to the public without regard to commercial return. The fund is managed and dispersed by the community foundation, a non-profit 501(c) 3 corporation.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Newspapers are closing and shrinking and, as in the case of the “Reno Gazette Journal,” cutting print publication days. There are fewer journalists: the Pew Research Center says U.S. newsroom employment dropped 26% between 2008 and 2021. A University of North Carolina study described many U.S. counties as “news deserts,” lacking coverage by professional journalists. A PEN America study concluded that, as local reporting declined, “government officials conduct themselves with less integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness” and corporate malfeasance often goes unnoticed. At the same time, however, a diversity of new news firms is emerging, often digital and nonprofit. Again, this is occurring in Nevada, with such digital-native organizations as the Reynolds School of Journalism’s Noticiero Móvil bilingual news service and The Hitchcock Project for Visualizing Science, among others. Amid this sort of experimentation, as the Columbia Journalism Review noted, “Local news, it seems, is both failing and transforming, suffering and succeeding, clinging to life and sustaining communities.” To address this situation, the Reynolds School launched the Project for the Revitalization of Local News. The goal of the project is to develop innovative approaches to sustaining and invigorating local journalism, on both legacy and native-digital platforms. The project draws upon the professional and scholarly resources of the RSJ, in collaboration with KUNR Public Media, which is a unit of the Reynolds School. The Project for the Revitalization of Local News has established two initial “test beds” to improve the news and information ecosystems in two Nevada communities: Elko and Incline Village. In Elko, KUNR’s sister station, KNCC, was established in 1992 with the intent to provide the Elko area with local news and cultural programming, in addition to national and world news through NPR, However, because of funding issues, the station has been limited throughout its history to rebroadcasting the signal of KUNR. As one of the founding initiatives of the Project for the Revitalization of Local News, the RSJ seeks to realize the original vision for KNCC by establishing local production capability at the Great Basin College facility, building studios and hiring journalists and producers to create local news, information and cultural programming. (This could also include programs in Basque, Spanish and Native American languages represented in the region.) The KNCC initiative would also provide academic opportunities for GBC students through internships, class projects and service learning. For Incline Village, the project seeks to establish a digital news site, based at UNR’s new Lake Tahoe campus, that would provide local journalism missing since the demise of the local Bonanza newspaper.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Today, the Reader is the Midwestâ€™s only media outlet with a full-time music editor and Chicagoâ€™s only outlet with a full-time music writer. Freelance writer Hannah Edgar provides substantive coverage of Chicagoâ€™s avant garde classical music scene. Similarly, theater and dance editor Kerry Reid works with staff and freelance writers to provide the most comprehensive coverage of the cityâ€™s theater culture. Arts and culture reporting and criticism at the Reader is viewed through a localist lens, as the team seeks to discover and cover art that has its genesis in Chicago, amplifying the artist output of Chicagoans. This goal of educating readers about the cultural offerings in Chicagoâ€™s neighborhoods and raising awareness of the many storefront venues and out-of-the-way cultural happenings is essential to the Readerâ€™s identity and mission. In 2024, the Reader will deepen and expand reporting with particular focus on small and midsize Chicago performing arts organizations that have struggled to remain sustainable in the wake of the pandemic. In particular, the publication will expand programs to grow and diversify its audience to include more members of under-reported communities, especially those in the South and West sides of Chicago. To accomplish this, the Reader will hire more freelancers who live in or write about those communities. In addition, the Reader will focus on increasing pay to market rate for writers, editors, and all Reader employees and freelancers. Support from the Paul M. Angell Family Foundation would enable the Reader to highlight the significance of Chicago musicians and music organizations and theater and theater organizations, increasing the viability of these performers and outlets as nonprofit businesses and improving the quality of life for all of Chicago.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Work in Senegal will include a detailed assessment of climate change-related data availability and use practices, identify data sources and actors, and ultimately develop a plan for improving the collection, governance, management, and use of climate data in that country. As part of the assessment process, PARIS21 will produce a General Climate Data Template that can be a starting point for creating a national inventory of global, regional, and local climate data requirements and needs in Senegal. PARIS21 will also complete a template on Open Climate Data to assess climate change data availability, openness, and use in several countries, drawing on ODW?s Open Data Inventory as a context for examining those issues in Senegal. Ultimately, this pilot in Senegal will create a scalable collaboration model to help other countries also leverage climate change data to advance effective and inclusive climate change adaptation policies while supporting international efforts around climate change mitigation. This grant will supplement the main grant supporting this work, by providing resources for French-English translation services for the key deliverables, and workshops.

Two years of the grant will make a meaningful difference in his ability to secure the future for solutions Journalism in Latin America. To this end, Jonathan, who has been with SJN since March 2023, has already started conversations with potential institutions and funders, such as the Fundación Gabo, the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, the Fundación Avina, DW Akademie and others. He will continue these conversations and expand them to others.To spread solutions journalism in Latin America. Jonathan will train and support a growing network of enthusiastic journalists and newsrooms. In this, SJN’s group of Accredited Trainers will work with Jonathan. Solutions journalism builds trust and strengthens civic engagement and hope by focusing on possibilities for the future. Our long-term aims are to make solutions journalism a tool in common use — one that Latin American newsrooms and journalists turn to when appropriate, just like investigative journalism — and to foster a community of solutions journalism practictioners that aligns with SJN's goal to build the decentralized capacity to deliver training to spur solutions reporting about urgent social challenges across the globe.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Access to advanced journalism education and training programs is limited in developing nations, and it is especially cost prohibitive for their media organizations to post correspondents at the U.N. The Fund has had a significant impact due to the dedication of the seasoned international UN journalists who volunteer to administer the program and to mentor the journalists. Direct program costs include: journalists' travel, modest accommodations (studio apartments), health/medical insurance, and a per diem of $60 for food/personal items. Administrative costs are kept to a minimum because the Fund does not maintain a separate office; the journalists work from journalists' offices, common space within the UN and the United Nations Correspondents Association (UNCA) club. During the Fellowship program the journalists are given access to all UN news conferences and proceedings and arrangements are made for them to meet with and/or interview high-level U.N. officials, including the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General, among others. Arrangements are made for meetings with independent media organizations, as well as nonprofit journalism organizations and educational institutions based in New York. The journalists are not confined to any particular subject and the contents of reports are not edited, including reports which may be somewhat critical of the UN. Guidance by board members and other UN journalists include directing the journalists to sources of information for background and guidance regardong the style of their reports.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

The first is inspired by the fact that there is no climate “solution” that does not include agriculture and food production. It primarily focuses on creative agricultural solutions to the climate crisis and the impediments such solutions face. The second explores a key aspect of the biodiversity crisis: How agriculture depletes biodiversity, and how, when managed sustainably, it can enhance biodiversity while feeding a growing population. With climate policy a major factor in the current presidential campaign and the biodiversity crisis a subject of international concern, we believe support for this reporting is essential to increasing public pressure on lawmakers and corporations and catalyzing change. We are also producing a podcast series on climate impacts on the Mississippi River basin. Our past policy impacts have demonstrated the power of wrapping the issues we cover — and the facts and science they entail — in great storytelling.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

We believe that it is important to provide this training for future journalists, and it is also important to teach students how to identify and report on factual information, particularly in this era of artificial intelligence and sensationalism. Making sure that all voices are heard, including diverse voices, is a primary program goal. However, participants must cover the cost of related housing, food, and travel. These expenses can prevent some students from participating in this internship, which has the potential to advance their education and/or career. With direct scholarship support, we can alleviate some of the financial burden of the internship – scholarships directly impact the ability of students to complete this program. A grant from the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust would allow SUNY New Paltz to increase the number of scholarships available to students from groups that have been underrepresented in journalism. As local journalism and news organizations struggle across the country, the Gazette is a longstanding example of innovative partnerships between students, journalism programs, and local news. The Gazette trains student journalists to meet the growing need for objective reporting from diverse voices, particularly on subjects like government and politics. The Gazette produces three to four podcasts during each spring semester (when the legislature is in session), which offers opportunities for journalism and production students to work together. Additionally, the Gazette collaborates with and publishes articles in local media outlets such as The River, an independent news outlet that covers the Hudson Valley and Catskills regions. To attract a diverse cohort of interns, it is critical for SUNY New Paltz to provide direct support for non-tuition educational expenses. During the spring and fall 2022 semesters, SUNY New Paltz awarded scholarships to 11 out of 22 Legislative Gazette interns. Of those awarded scholarships, four students are female and seven are people of color. Scholarships received during that time period were greatly appreciated by the recipients. Scholarship recipient Austin Jefferson ’23 said of the internship: “The experience I have had has been transformative. I went into the internship unsure of my future in media and came out loving journalism and possessing an aptitude I didn’t know I had. Now I have a resume that sets me apart.” Funds raised for scholarships in one calendar year are awarded the following year through an application process, thus your grant from 2022, along with the additional matching funds that we raised, will be awarded during the 2023-2024 academic year. Students apply for the scholarships in March and are notified they will receive them in April. Support received in 2023 will be used for scholarships in the 2024-2025 academic year.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

We are building a new kind of journalism from the ground up - community-powered journalism that genuinely reflects all of us, an inclusive journalism outlet — from our content to our research sources, from our staff to our internal culture, and from our funding sources to our supporters. We value contributions from community members with different backgrounds, politics, ages, and more. Our work responds to the needs of the communities we serve. We focus on civics, not politics. We believe political coverage has become corrupted by “he said/she said” discourse on issues. Our civics coverage and explainers will forge a better understanding of how the government works, what it does and doesn’t do, and who the people making decisions are. We prioritize collaboration over competition. We partner with like-minded, independent, and nonprofit organizations to fill in the gaps in our coverage, so we can focus on the things we do well: environmental, civics, and cultural stories from the Sierra Nevada and beyond. Because after all, we can go much further together than any of us can go alone. As a community, we invest directly in feeding the hungry, educating our kids, protecting the vulnerable, supporting the arts, and caring for neighbors touched by tragedy. It’s not a function of returns; it’s how we sustain a livable society that reflects our values. In other words, it’s the right thing to do. Likewise, we must invest in universal access to verifiable, factual information about our world. We believe independent, non-profit, non-partisan journalism of, by, and for the people of Nevada is the solution. When the Ally succeeds, more of our region’s residents communicate their needs and expectations to their elected officials; more hold those officials accountable when expectations are unmet; more run for office and volunteer for community boards; more attend school board meetings, open houses, and roundtable discussions; more submit comments to federal land management planning processes; more participate in economic development and policy-reform collaboration. Everyone so engaged does so with full and ready access to the relevant facts, objective analysis, and context they need.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

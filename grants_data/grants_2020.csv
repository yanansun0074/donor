Lead by a team of veteran broadcasters, KCLU is consistently ranked as the number one news station in the region. Although KCLU's general news coverage is exemplary (KCLU has won over 300 awards for its outstanding local news), until The Amgen Foundation awarded KCLU a $100,000 grant in 2016, and $50,000 grants in 2018 & 2019, KCLU could not dedicate a reporter to focus on covering science and technology. With The Amgen Foundation's partnership, KCLU shared in half the cost of hiring a STEM reporter and since then has consistently produced and aired science-based stories. KCLU serves a region abundant with biotechnology, education and healthcare stories waiting to be told. We are once again respectfully submitting a grant request to The Amgen Foundation for continued funding to support a science and technology reporter for another two years. Sophisticated in digital, social and traditional media and in working with community groups and newsmakers, KCLU will use its on air and website presence to highlight the on-air feature stories and will archive them online for public use. Like The Amgen Foundation, KCLU would like to help inspire the scientists of tomorrow and the general public today by continuing to produce science and technology stories that will educate, inform and enlighten.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Support will enable the Society to contribute content leading to three pathways on Labxchange. Additionally, the Society will promote Labxchange to our millions of readers and followers through print and online marketing and social media and at our competitions and events. Over two years, we will promote the site through two print ads in SN; 250,000 banner impressions on sciencenews.Org; and 250,000 banner ad impressions on sciencenewsforstudents.Org. We will also provide Labxchange with a booth in the STEM Experiential Hall at Virtual ISEF 2021 which, in 2020, was visited by more than 5,000 of the 18,500 ISEF registrants. The Society will continually explore impactful ways to leverage our audiences and promote Labxchange. This may include the continuation of being featured on our Research at Home webpage; promotion during or participation in annual Research Teachers Conferences (one for middle school educators and one for high school educators); booths in virtual STEM research competitions; and opportunities to speak of be promoted at STEM events.

They will be given the opportunity to produce news reports for TV, radio, print media and/or Internet using the tools imparted. They will be trained as Positive Reporters who will present positive stories to their peers and Headline News. Participants will also visit media newsrooms through digital tools. The students will interact and work together through the virtual tool allowed by the Dept. Of Education, in the development and implementation of the news.

American history begins with the creation of a myth to absolve white settlers of the genocide of Native Americans: the false belief that nonwhite people are less human than white people. This belief in racial hierarchy survived slavery’s abolition, fueled racial terror lynchings, demanded legally codified segregation, and spawned our mass incarceration crisis. EJI is engaging with communities and encouraging all Americans to confront our history of racial injustice and its legacy. We’re exposing the myth and its toxic legacy in our reports and videos—and on this page. Our Community Remembrance Project is empowering communities to change the physical landscape to honestly reflect our history. And we’re using the power of place to inspire people to visit Montgomery, Alabama, to learn and reflect in our Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. EJI’s public education campaigns and racial justice initiatives reach hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life. Our staff routinely presents to students, community organizations, human rights advocates, policymakers, and faith groups. We distribute reports on slavery, lynching and segregation and have created curricula for educators. We have worked with community leaders across the South to erect markers at lynching sites. We have hosted men, women and children from across the country and from over two dozen foreign countries.

As an organization, we are well-networked with other Indigenous scientists and ethicists working in the realm of data science and Indigenous data sovereignty. We can leverage our reputation and network to create a unique data science and informatics training opportunity for tribal college students. Training the next generation of Indigenous data science leaders is important as data becomes the number one commodity and a must-have skill for tribal community members. Our aim is to deliver culturally-inclusive data science training opportunities through a one-week summer virtual workshop. By including Indigenous data scientists and academics as instructors, we also aim to build mentorship networks and encourage interest in data science careers. Furthermore, by contextualizing curricula in the context of Indigenous data sovereignty and empowerment, we hope to build trust in data ethics and encourage the next generation of data policy leaders in tribal communities.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

The initial program established a strong foundation for bilingual media education in the Reynolds School, including an academic emphasis within the RSJ, a dual degree with the Spanish Department, the Noticiero Mvil news service, and a broadcast partnership with KUNR public radio. These initiatives received national acclaim, including the Online News Associations Grand Prize for Innovation in Journalism Education, two Edward R. Murrow Awards for the KUNR partnership from the Radio Television Digital News Association, and an innovation award from the Public Media Journalists Association. In addition, the Reynolds School received the Equity and Diversity Award from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, which prominently noted our bilingual initiatives in the award citation. Our bilingual media initiatives address a significant need within journalism education and the journalism professions. This is driven in part by demographic changes in our region as recent census data found the population of Washoe County is nearly 30% Hispanic. There is also strong demand from professional media organizations nationwide for bilingual journalists and strategic communicators (a reference to advertising, public relations and marketing practitioners). At the same time there is a dearth of Spanish-language media and marketing firms in northern Nevada. The proposed program expansion would take our bilingual media initiatives to the next level by adding the following elements: Bilingual legislative coverage by Noticiero Mvil Bilingual documentary film production Bilingual science journalism, in partnership with our Mick Hitchcock, PH.D., Project for Visualizing Science Bilingual health communication campaigns (including use of multilingual smart speakers), drawing upon our partnerships with the UNR School of Medicine, School of Community Health Sciences and Sanford Center for Aging Production of Spanish-language podcasts This proposed expansion would thereby integrate bilingual education across most aspects of the Reynolds School curriculum.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/

Have you ever thought that your story can be a ray of hope for someone else? Have you ever heard the saying, “your trials come to make you stronger? It may be hard to believe but it is true. There is a scripture that says, “for you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow…” It is through our trials and tribulations that we need the most help. During these times, what has given us HOPE is the testimonies of others who have endured the journey. They have made it through to the other side, and they reach back to bring us through. These very people are “wounded Healer.” What is the Wounded Healer Project? Twenty-four women come together to share their testimony/story of a time when they endured an event that caused suffering, various difficulties, or hardship. What is unique about these stories is they include the name of one Sistah who help pull them through. The stories will be compiled into a self-published book and shared with other women who are wounded. Our guest writers will submit their story – they will receive an invitation with the following information: WHAT – Story/Testimony – As a guest writer, they will provide a 500 – 800-word testimony/story, including the Sistah’s name that helped to pull you through. It will be only one person named in their story. • At the end of their story, they will include the answer to the following questions: o Have you ever considered that you were a wounded healer? O What would be your last words of HOPE to the readers of this book? • Provide two paragraphs to sum up, their bio or information about who they are. Each guest writer will be asked to donate $100 towards the projected. In return for participating, they will receive ten copies of the book.",http://foundationcenter.org/gain-knowledge/foundation-data/data-sources/
